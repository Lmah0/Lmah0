# Hi, I'm Liam ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I'm a software engineering student at the University of Calgary with a deep passion for aerospace software and aeronautics.

I currently work at a leading defense company, specializing in aeronautics and advanced development programs for unmanned vehicle control software. As the Avionics Engineering Lead for Schulich Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, I oversee all aspects of electrical, systems, and software engineering. Prior to this, I've worked at Schlumberger (SLB), contributing to the development of Symmetry process simulation software.

My current projects are oriented towards flight control software, embedded systems, computer-vehicle communications and networking, imaging systems, and convolutional neural network artifical intelligence.

In my free time, you can find me watching football or hockey, taking care of my dog, and spending time with friends.
